      <description>This is the personal site of Dr Oliver Margetts (olliemath).
For a while I wanted to understand how the universe worked and went as far as to get a PhD in mathematical physics. Having watched the horizon of knowlege recede further the more I learnt, I decided it was much more satisfying to use my mathematical brain to write software!
Since leaving academia I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a senior software engineer, and have been privelidged enough to be VP of Engineering at a startup.</description>
