This is the personal site of Dr Oliver Margetts (olliemath).

For a while I wanted to understand how the universe worked and
went as far as to get a PhD in mathematical physics. Having watched
the horizon of knowlege recede further the more I learnt, I decided
it was much more satisfying to use my mathematical brain to write
software!

Since leaving academia I've been working as a senior software engineer,
and have been privelidged enough to be VP of Engineering at a startup.
Mostly I enjoy building new things, polishing old things, and writing
about software.

All opinions are my own and do not reflect those of my employers.
